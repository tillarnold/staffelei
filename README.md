# Staffelei

`Staffelei` is a utility class that makes working with the 2D Canvas API (`CanvasRenderingContext2D`) easier.
The `Staffelei` class extends the [`Leinwand`](https://github.com/tillarnold/leinwand)-class. Thus you get all the method chaining goodness
form there. Additionally `Staffelei` provides methods from [canvas-utils](https://github.com/tillarnold/canvas-utils).
